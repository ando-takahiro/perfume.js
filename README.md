# Perfume.js

@syoyo requests me [perfume bvh player](http://perfume-dev.github.com/) using three.js. So I made it based on [flash-example](https://github.com/perfume-dev/example-flash)

you can check [here](http://ando-takahiro.github.com/perfume.js/).

## Be careful!

 * synchronize between music and motion is broken
 * not js style code
 * no free camera
 * no ground
 * load time is too long
 * checked on mac os x chrome & safari
 * does not run on iPad

## Hacking

 * index.html: entry point
 * src/perfume.js: bvh motion core logic (from flash-example)

## Future plan

I don't know. Please ask @syoyo.
